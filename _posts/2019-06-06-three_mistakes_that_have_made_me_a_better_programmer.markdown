I would like to start this post by saying everyone makes mistakes. Mistakes are great learning tools and the three I feel I learned the most from as a beginner are listed below, in no particular order. Additionally this blog is meant to make you aware of the mistakes, teach you to spot signs of them, and remind you to try and avoid them.

**1) Write Code with a Plan***
Programming is more often than not about reading previous code, researching what is needed  and planning the writing of features with small, testable increments. The process of writing lines of code may only be about 10% of the whole process.

Do not think about programming as writing lines of code. Programming is a logic-based creativity that needs careful planning.

**2) Code Quality**
If you can only focus on one aspect of the code that you write, it should be its quality. Unclear code is not reusable and will be hard for other programmers to understand.

Never underestimate the importance of code quality. Look at coding as a way to communicate. For example, you should be consistent with your indentation and capitalization. In my opinion it shows you have standards; inconsistent indentation can be interpreted as laziness.

**3) Don't Pick your First Solution**
When I started writing programs, I would find a solution to a problem and run with it. I would rush to the first fix I found instead of considering the complexities and possible failures of my first solution.

Obviously the first solution is tempting, but the good solutions are  discovered once you start questioning different solutions to the problem. Also, being able to conceive multiple solutions to a problem, shows you have a good understanding of the problem.

A responsibility of being a competent professional programmer is to find the simplest solution to the problem. A solution that works correctly and performs in a way that is easy enough to read, understand, and maintain.
