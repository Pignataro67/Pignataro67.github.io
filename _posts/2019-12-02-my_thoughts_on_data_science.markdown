For me, the thing about data science that makes it so exciting to the modern world is its uniqueness.
Data science allows me to dive deep with computer science and mathematics into the past to improve performances in any discipline for the future. It is the bridge between past and future, the stepping stone that can drive our perceptions wider, our insights and knowledge base deeper, empowering us to make more accurate predictions and decisions in many fields.
Data science can be applied universally, with enormous scope and potential to improve life across many areas.
Today as more people around the world own a personal computer or even two and information technology has grown exponentially, big data has to, too, and is going to continue to grow. Data science is at the cutting edge of directing the growth of data and hence is at the forefront of our collective future. As a data scientist you are given huge scope to take part in driving the success of any discipline.
Data science is exciting as it has tremendous scope for development and growth, it allows me to sit at the cutting edge of the future of technology, taming the way we structure, utilize and understand data.
