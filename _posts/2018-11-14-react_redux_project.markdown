 The Journey is almost over and what an amazing experience it has been! There are so many ups and downs with programming and this project was my favorite so far. I created it by incorporating another passion of mine- video games. I watched a lot of the videos, most multiple times, to get ideas on the structure of this project.  As usual, the videos were very helpful.  The React dev Tools were also very helpful because you can see the state updating in real time. I re-read the curriculum and took notes to help me prepare. They were a little difficult to install, I used the Virtual Box and had to install Chromium to get the dev tools to install. 

  This app was built with React/Redux and a Rails API. Video Game Library is for users to look through the catalog of video games, which range from NES, Playstation, and Xbox; no PC games, I've always been only a fan of console games.  

  In this project, I have created a React/Redux Front End. The front end uses react to make calls to the actions in the client folder. Actions are then forwarded to the reducers. The Reducers then create new state and the life-cycle repeats itself. I am making fetch requests to actions/methods in the rails controller and then rendering the response to the containers. Fetch requests retrieve data from the server and display it.

  In Summation, This project has been my favorite to build so far. I look forward to continuing to learn as much as I can, now outside of the curriculum and begin my job search!
