One of the biggest issues I have heard beginners have with learning Rails is understanding all the great things it does to help you create an app.

Rails can quickly help you create big, complex apps. This power comes from all the things Rails is doing behind the scences. Rails does a lot of complex things in the background that are hidden with 'smoke and mirrors' so to speak. This is where all the great things Rails does happens.

Sinatra is a small web framework written in Ruby. Sinatra is capable of helping you to make small web applications quickly. Similar to Rails, Sinatra is built on Rack so you can think of it as a lesser version of Rails. Everything in Sinatra is straight to the point, there are no 'great things' happening behind the scences. This is why learning Sinatra Basics before Rails can be so helpful. It gives you a great jump start before diving into Rails.

Rails will create the file-structure for you, Sinatra won't. However for someone like me and for anyone building smaller apps, this is great. I did not have any experience with file structures, so this was a big help creating my own file structures with Sinatra.The benefit of creating the file structure yourself is it helps you get a feel for how to set up routes and organize your views in Sinatra. After learning that the more complex file structures and methods in Rails will make more sense than if Sinatra Basics were not understood first.

Sinatra, again, is pretty straight forward, but you can build very impressive apps with it.
