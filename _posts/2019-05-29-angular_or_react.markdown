There is no doubt that React is causing a front end upheaval when it comes to choosing a method of coding interfaces. Angular feels like its been in the market for a long time. However, the current framework was only released in 2016. React, initially released in 2013, only gained popularity after Facebook changed their BSD license to MIT.

So what’s the big deal with Angular? and why, exactly, are developers still using and recommending it?

React gives developers more flexibility, giving them choices over architectures and structures. Angular is not very flexible and forces you to use a specific structure with your project.

Angular is very opinionated, which means that your app has to be written a certain way for things to work properly. While this may be unyielding, there is a perk-- once you learn the structures, every Angular app that you come across will have something in common with the last.

Minimally, similarities between Angular apps will consist of the Angular component, the three piece creation of css and html for your view. With React, its flexibility is also its weakness because new React developers can create without restrictions, which can lead to bad practices or shaky architectures.  Best practices are learned after enough mistakes have been made and the best known solutions arise. On the other hand Angular forces these solutions on you in order to maintain a sense of cohesion in the way things are built.

The original version of Angular had a more free reign approach, similar to React’s ability to conform with an existing application. However, as applications grew and teams changed, a higher chance of applications breaking separation of concerns arose.

Angular’s ability to enforce industry standards with this architecture resulted in uniformity among applications. 

**Final Thoughts**

The battle between Angular and React can be rather opinionated from both sides. But it is wise to note that they are two very different things in terms of scope and architecture that ultimately produces a front end solution. They both solve issues that the other doesn’t adequately address — and depending on the situation, one solution might be better than the other.
