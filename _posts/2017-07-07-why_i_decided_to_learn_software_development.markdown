  # I have always had a fascination with computers and how they work, even on a robotic level. I am a huge fan of "The Transformers" '80s' cartoon, but I digress.  I was always somewhat intimidated by computer programming. I took a basic computer programming class in high school and enjoyed it a lot. Twenty years later, I can still hear myself and several of my friends laughing at how our teacher would say, "Print, colon, print, colon." Throughout college all of my courses had nothing to do with computers.  Upon graduation I already was working full time and used computers to look up inventory items and other information.
	# I decided after my sixteenth year of employment for the same company, I needed a change. A change that again did not involve computers. I began a career as a personal trainer. It was at this point, during my spare time that I began reading about computer programming. I enjoyed it a lot. I began picking up more clients as a personal trainer and many of them worked in the tech industry. Some are Data Analyisists and we would discuss the languages they were learning. A couple were Software Engineers who I am still training today. Occassionally we will exchange trade tips, which help both of us.
	# In summation, I am excited to begin this new journey. During my sixteen years for the same company, I picked up the nickname "Rain Man" for my ability to remember numbers. I am hopeful this ability will help me on my way to becoming a computer programmer.
