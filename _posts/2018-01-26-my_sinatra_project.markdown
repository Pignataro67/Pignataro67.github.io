   I decided to continue with my CLI project idea of creating an exercise/workout application. I currently work as a personal trainer, so an application such as this will also be helpful for me because I can store my client's workouts in it.  The application also grants access to each user's workouts so they can make changes if needed and only they have access to change/edit their workouts. They also have access to other's workouts if they need exercise ideas, but they cannot change other user's workouts.
   This project was a lot of fun. I attended study groups and they were helpful with Sinatra concepts and understanding that other students had the same concerns/worries as I did about completing this project.  I was not as scared about this project as much as the first one, but it did have the same highs and lows that any project comes with.  The time it takes to correct an error or find a bug, and then you realize it was only a spelling mistake.  
   Some concepts we discussed in Study groups were the http request cycle and redirect and redirect to.  Redirect sends the HTTP header to redirect the client to a given URL, and the argument passed should be a URL with a host, not just /path.  The redirect to method converts a path to a full URL, allowing the resulting URL to be used in redirect.
   Sinatra is a great framework for setting up an app and a very good tool to have for completing this project.  Looking back on the process of creating this project, I could have done a better job of trusting my knowledge of the curriculum. As I mentioned above, this project was a lot of fun. Once I re-familiarized myself with many of the coding concepts and planned out what I wanted to do, it became an even more fun experience. I am excited to move forward with the rest of the curriculum.
