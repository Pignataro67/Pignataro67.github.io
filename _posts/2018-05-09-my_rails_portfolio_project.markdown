	What a Journey it has been so far. There are so many ups and downs with programming and this project had many of them. Even after finishing the project, or thinking you have, you think you're there, everything is working, and then BOOM, an error. Luckily it wasn't one of those errors that makes you question everything, but it was not an easy error either, i.e. under 20 minutes. No, this one takes the better part of an hour mostly because you can't see straight from staring at a computer screen for hours. Then you find it, and it was something you checked at least 3 times and know it was right, but it ends up being a simple spelling/misplaced punctuation mark; a semi-colon in this case. 
  Rails has features that makes some things easier to start an app, such as a scaffold generator.  The scaffold generator adds a lot of files and code, front and back-end code, which is good because it adds CRUD capabilities to your app.  This feature is great if you're looking to hit the ground running with a new app, however, you will not learn as much with this generator as you would with others.
	I prefer the resource generator because it offers just enough to get your app going AND you can still learn a lot, especially when you're still learning Rails. The resource generator will create the base setup for your app and it will not control the implementation like the scaffold generator can.  Some of the specific files the resource generator creates are migration, model, controller, view directory, etc. Occasionally, I also like to create most files, except for my migrations, by hand so I know exactly what is going into my app.
	If I had to explain to someone about Rails, I would tell them if they want to get an app going quickly to use a scaffold generator to learn the complexity of it, if they want to have some help and learn while they create, to use the resource generator, and if they want complete control, and a great learning opportunity, to create the files by hand.
