 The CLI Gem Project was very intimidating at first. Staring at a blank screen, having no idea where to begin, can be very frustrating. I had a couple ideas for topics, and I decided on making a program that would give the user exercise options. They could pick a bodypart to workout and an exercise for that bodypart would be displayed. 
  Object Oriented Ruby is a great programming language and was a very good tool to have for completing this project. I started out by finding a website in which I could get my exercise information. I then wanted to start building my project with fake data to see where I was going, to see in which direction I was headed. The Web Scraping part was difficult at first, but by the end I was really enjoying it. It was fun using the terminal with binding.pry to show the HTML and then finding the data I was looking for. My project involved scraping data for five different exercises and by the end I was taking "educated guesses" to find the data I needed without using binding.pry. 
	I was just about done with my project when I noticed I was getting an error when certain keyboard selections were made. I spent some time improving my input.to_i method. I was trying to implement different methods/variations of methods and nothing was giving me what I wanted. I then reviewed some of the past labs, the Tic Tac Toe labs in particular, and found what I was looking for. I found not only the answer to correct my input method, but a reason to get excited because I solved my problem and the program was now working the way it was intended.
	Looking back on the process of creating this project, I could have done a better job of believing and trusting myself that I could complete the project. As I mentioned above, it was very intimidating at first. Once I refamiliarized myself with many of the coding concepts and planned out what I wanted to do, it became a very enjoyable experience. I am excited to move forward with the rest of the curriculum.
