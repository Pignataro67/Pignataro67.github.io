We all love images but, they are heavy on bandwidth and performance if not used responsively. There are many aspects to optimizing images for the web. Starting from which image format to use in which situation to how to make them work for different screen sizes.

Letâ€™s begin by talking about image formats. These days, we can use Jpeg, Png, Svg and gif formats. You may be thinking, "How do I decide which format to use?" Svg images have a smaller file size and they are vector images that never pixelate, no matter how much you scale them. They can also be modified using CSS. I would always use svg images for logo, icons, and animation. Jpeg images are great when you want a very detailed image, although the file size can be much greater. Png images also serve the same purpose and have a somewhat smaller file size than jpeg.

No matter which file format you choose, images always should be compressed using tools such as File Optimizer for Jpeg and Spritebot for Svgs. These tools can significantly reduce the file size without compromising the quality of the image. It is also worth paying attention to the actual dimensions of the images and making sure that the height and width of your images is relevant to the screen size. Also, you should not serve up an image twice as big as what will fit the screen. If you want to go one step further, you can also use media queries to serve up different sized versions of your image for different screen sizes.

All these techniques can save you precious bytes and help you optimize site performance while still making your site as beautiful as possible with all of your favorite images.
