Currently I'm in my job search and I'm noticing a common job requirement, which is having experience with Azure. In an effort to get to know this a little better, I've decided to research Azure, and see why we need it.

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service for building, testing, deploying, and managing apps and services. The aforementioned is done through data-centers. Azure is a cloud computing provider developed by Microsoft.

There are several things that Azure does and listed below, in no particular order, are several of those things. These are the main categories of Azure’s capability:

1. Infrastructure as a Service: This may be considered the most basic of the services, because you are basically renting the IT infrastructure that you need, including servers, networks, operating systems, etc.
 
2. Platform as a Service: This is one step up from IaaS, which is Infrastructure as a service, as this provides the IT infrastructure you need AND an on-demand environment for developing, testing, and deploying apps.
 
3. Serverless Computing: Serverless computing is similar to PaaS, which is Platform as a service. This cloud computing service only executes when a specific event tells it to.

4. Software as a Service: This service will deliver software applications over the Internet, usually on a subscription basis.

Now that we know some basics of Azure, you may be asking yourself, "Why is cloud computing beneficial over a traditional set up?"

Upon researching, in my opinion, scale and cost are two main points to look at. In terms of scale, which is much 'simpler' and less complex when compared to cost, expanding your storage capabilities is as easy as clicking a button.  On the other hand, the cost of buying software and hardware, running an on-site data-center, assembling a team of people to manage the data-center, keeping the data-center powered all the time, etc, are all very costly reasons to switch to cloud computing.

Thanks for reading my blog,  hope you enjoyed it.
