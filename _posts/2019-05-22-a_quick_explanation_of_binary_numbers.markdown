To understand binary numbers, first let’s review some terminology by using decimal numbers as an example. Decimal numbers are the numbers we grew up counting with. They are also referred to as base 10 numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). We have a total of 10 different numbers in a decimal number system and we use combinations of these 10 numbers. Let’s talk about decimal places. Consider the number below,

111

The three ones in 111 have different values because of their decimal places. The rightmost 1 has a value of 1 since it is in the 1’s place. The one in the middle has a value of 10 since it is in the 10’s place and the leftmost number has a value of 100 since it is in the 100’s place. And that’s how we get,

100 + 10 + 1 = 111

One thing to notice is the places in the decimal number system are sequential powers on 10:

10 to the power of 0 = 1
10 to the power of 1 = 10
10 to the power of 2 = 100 and so on

Now you may be thinking "How does this apply to Binary or base-2 numbers?" Unlike decimal numbers, binary numbers have only 2 numbers, 0 and 1. Also, places in binary are sequential powers of 2, for example:

2 to the power of 0 = 1
2 to the power of 1 = 2
2 to the power of 2 = 4
2 to the power of 3 = 8
2 to the power of 4 = 16 and so on…

Let’s try to read 101 in binary. Here the rightmost 1 is in 1’s place, the zero is in 2’s place and the leftmost 1 is in 4’s place. That’s how we get:

4 + 0 + 1 = 5

Let’s take another example and break down 1001 in binary. Reading this from right to left, a 1 is in 1’s place, a 0 is in 2’s place, a 0 is in 4’s place and the leftmost 1 is in 8’s place that’s how we get:

8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9

That is how we can read and write Binary or Base-2 numbers.
